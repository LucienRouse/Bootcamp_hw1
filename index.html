<!--the initial html had pretty much everything sepperated by div lines. 
The first thing that I did was to put everything in semantic style, and to change div lines to something more specific
Below, I changed the div to Header, but had to leave the div in for the unordered links-->

<Header class="header">
    <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
    <div>
    <ul >
        <li>
            <!--You changed the class for each link to "links" so that they can be easily grouped with 
            the same styling in CSS-->
            <a href="#search-engine-optimization" class="links" alt="engine_op">Search Engine Optimization</a>
        </li>
        <li>
