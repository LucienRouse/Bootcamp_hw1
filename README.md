First boot camp homework

This is the first assignment for the boocamp.  We were given the HTML, CSS, and images for a simple website homepage. 
We were instructed to correct any bugs in the code, add semantic structure, and ensure that all the links functioned properly.
We were instructed to condense the CSS.
All of this was supposed to be done without changing the layout of the webpage.
